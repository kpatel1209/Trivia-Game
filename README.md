# TriviaGame

I created a Sports Trivia game where the user clicks on the "Click to Play" button to start the game.  There will be 12 questions to answer that were randomly ordered from the array they are stored in.  

The user is given 15 seconds to review and answer each question.  The user can hover their cursor over the answer selections and see the selection change to a bold blue color.  Once the user clicks on an answer, the game will tell the user if they are correct or wrong and will display the image of the correct answer.

If the user does not make a selection in 15 seconds, then the game will display that time is up and will also display the correct answer.  The user can try to answer the next question(s).

After all of the questions have looped, the user will get to see their final results.  I was not able to code a restart function successfully, so at this time, the user will have to refresh the webpage in order to play again.
